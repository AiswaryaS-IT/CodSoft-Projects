# Java Console-Based Applications
This repository contains three different Java console-based applications: an ATM Simulation, a Student Grade Calculator, and a Guess the Number game. Each program demonstrates basic programming concepts and interactive user interfaces using the console.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. ATM Simulation
The ATM Simulation program allows users to perform basic banking operations like withdrawing, depositing, and checking their account balance.

Features:
Withdraw: Allows users to withdraw money with validation to prevent overdrawing.
Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account. If the balance falls below Rs. 1500, a Rs. 150 fine is deducted.
Check Balance: Displays the current balance in the userâ€™s account.
Notes:
A minimum balance of Rs. 1500 is required, and if the balance falls below this, a Rs. 150 fine is charged.

### 2. Student Grade Calculator
The Student Grade Calculator program calculates the total marks, percentage, and assigns a grade based on the marks entered by the user.

Features:
Total Marks Calculation: Users can enter marks for multiple subjects, and the program will calculate the total.
Percentage Calculation: Computes the percentage based on the total marks and number of subjects.
Grade Assignment: The program assigns grades based on the calculated percentage, ranging from A to F.
Grade Scale:
A: Above 90%
B: 81-90%
C: 71-80%
D: 61-70%
E: 51-60%
F: Below 50%

### 3. Guess the Number Game
The Guess the Number game challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Players have limited lives and points

Features:
Random Number Generation: The user sets a range for the random number to be generated.
Guessing Mechanism: The player guesses the number, with hints provided if the guess is too high or too low.
Points and Lives: Players start with 300 points and 3 lives. Each incorrect guess reduces points and lives.
Win or Lose: The game ends when the player either guesses the correct number or loses all lives.
How to Play:
Set a limit to generate a random number within the range.
Guess the number and receive feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
Win by guessing the correct number or lose when all lives are exhausted.
